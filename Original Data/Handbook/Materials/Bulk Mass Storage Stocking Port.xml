				<Text>The mass storage stocking port must be placed adjacent to a mass storage crate.  Pressing E will open the interface for configuring the stocked item and inventory limit.  The port will only add the stocked item if the current stock is below the specified limit.  Other items will always be added as though it were a standard input port.  
				
				Hold Ctrl, Shift, or Alt when adjusting the stocking limits to change the limits in 10, 100, or 1000 item increments.

				You can right click the empty slot to search for an item by name to easily set the stock item or press the button to choose an item.  Multiblock components are special so they won't be found by a normal search instead search for "multi", "placement", or "component" for a list of these blocks.
				
				The port's internal inventory can be locked using the labeled button in the interface to prevent the port from collecting items if the stock limit has been reached.  This function is intended to enable limiting the backlog of high value items.
