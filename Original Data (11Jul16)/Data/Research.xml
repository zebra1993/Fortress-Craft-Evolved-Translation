		<PreDescription>Your suit contains a black box that stored all sensor readings leading up to your crash on this planet. Researching this data could help you determine what exactly happened.</PreDescription>
		<PostDescription>A thorough analysis of the black box data recorded by your suit has now been completed. It confirms your visual analysis that a foreign object, believed to be a meteor, hit the station as you were preparing to dock. The resulting explosion damaged your ship's manoeuvring thrusters causing a crash landing on this alien plant. No other survivors have been detected at this time.</PostDescription>

		<PostDescription>This planet appears to contain a variety of plant and animal life, not all of it friendly. Scanners are detecting a number of flying lifeforms nearby which pose a potential risk. Designs for a Threat Scanner are available to monitor their progress. We should also investigate setting up some base defenses. Potentially more concerning we have detected a number of large organic structures underground which could interfere with our efforts to secure a reliably supply of resources.</PostDescription>

		<PreDescription>Your environmental suit is the most advanced piece of exploration engineering known to man. Unfortunately its utility depends upon a modular upgrade system currently beyond our manufacturing capabilities. It is time to look into how you can create your own upgrades away from the factories back home. You can use a bit of help surviving in this harsh environment.</PreDescription>
		<PostDescription>With some minor adjustments, it should be possible to produce suit upgrades from basic machinery design, miniaturised to be wearable. The most obvious upgrades are a better solar cell and cold insulation to operate at higher efficiency on this hostile planet. You're going to need to use a Hydrojet Cutter upgrade on your Manufacturing Plant for this!</PostDescription>
